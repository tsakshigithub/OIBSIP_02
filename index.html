                    <b> Sarojini Naidu</b> ( Chattopadhyay; 13 February 1879 - 2 March 1949) was an Indian political
                    activist
                    and poet. A proponent of civil rights, women's emancipation, and anti-imperialistic ideas, she was
                    an important figure in India's struggle for independence from colonial rule. Naidu's work as a poet
                    earned her the sobriquet 'the Nightingale of India', or 'Bharat Kokila' by Mahatma Gandhi because of
                    colour, imagery and lyrical quality of her poetry.
                </p> <br>
                <p> Beginning in 1904, Naidu became an increasingly popular orator, promoting Indian independence and
                    women's rights, especially women's education.Her oratory often framed arguments following the
                    five-part rhetorical structures of Nyaya reasoning.She addressed the Indian National Congress and
                    the Indian Social Conference in Calcutta in 1906.Her social work for flood relief earned her the
                    Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in 1911, which she later returned in protest over the April 1919 Jallianwala
                    Bagh massacre.[citation needed] She met Muthulakshmi Reddy in 1909, and in 1914 she met Mahatma
                    Gandhi, whom she credited with inspiring a new commitment to political action.She was the second
                    woman President of the Indian National Congress and first indian woman to preside over the INC
                    conference .</p> <br>
                <p>
                    With Reddy, she helped established the Women's Indian Association in 1917. Later that year, Naidu
                    accompanied her colleague Annie Besant, who was the president of Home Rule League and Women's Indian
                    Association, to advocate universal suffrage in front of the Joint Select Committee in London, United
                    Kingdom.[citation needed] She also supported the Lucknow Pact, a joint Hindu-Muslim demand for
                    British political reform, at the Madras Special Provincial Council. As a public speaker, Naidu's
                    oratory was known for its personality and its incorporation of her poetry.
                </p> <br> <br>
                <h4>Governor of United Provinces</h4> <br>
                <p> Following India's independence from the British rule in 1947, Naidu was appointed the governor of
                    the United
                    Provinces (present-day Uttar Pradesh), making her India's first woman governor. She remained in
                    office until
                    her death in March 1949 (aged 70).</p>
